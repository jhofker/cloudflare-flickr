Pretty sure I forgot to do this on Saturday, even though I had a photo selected and everything!  
  
The other day, the clouds were [particularly awesome](https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=moorhead%20clouds&w=53994612@N00) outside with scattered storms rolling through and everything. I ended up taking a few different photos while I was over in Moorhead feeding [Joel and Meghan's kitties](https://www.flickr.com/search/?w=53994612@N00&q=lily+OR+lucy&m=text), but I liked this one the best.  
  
It took a little planning to do right, considering I can't very well look through the viewfinder while driving. So I stopped, set things about where I needed them and figured out the angle I'd need to get the shot. Then I drove slow enough to get someone behind and shot a few.
