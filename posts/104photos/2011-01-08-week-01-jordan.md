Winter here means snow, and lots of it. You may remember [last week](https://104photos.blogspot.com/2011/01/week-52-jordan.html) when Molly took my picture cleaning out the snow. Well, favor returned – the picture below of her and Roxy is in the same spot. By the way, free snow to anyone that drives up here to get it.
