We went to the [Red River Valley Fair](https://redrivervalleyfair.com/2010/) last weekend. Among other things, we went to the [small circus](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jhofker/tags/garciabrotherscircus/) that was showing. Despite being really warm out (for Fargo), we had a good time and mainly just walked around to look at things. All the photos from the fair are [right here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jhofker/sets/72157624467726520) if you're interested.
