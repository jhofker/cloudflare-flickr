Not much to say about the past week. It was pretty nice outside which allowed some of the snow to melt and then make everything under it really heavy. Also allowed us to go out for a walk. That’s about it. Had a lazy Saturday after we original hoped to have people over – the weather had other ideas as freezing rain coated the streets and our driveway, and then followed up with a rousing good couple inches of snow. “Yay”

Here’s Roxy chilling out on the couch. I haven’t done a dog picture since last year, so it’s totally okay now!

Canon XSi with EF 50mm f/1.8 @ 50mm 1/60s f/1.8 ISO 800. With the window behind her, I grabbed the largest white object I could find (a book of dog tricks) and used it to reflect light back towards her face.
