My mom and sister were visiting us, so I managed to forget to get out and take a photo of something. Molly prepared a very tasty dinner of [maniladas](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/sunny-anderson/maniladas-with-white-cheese-and-roasted-tomatillo-sauces-recipe/index.html), so they’re the subject this week.
