Last Sunday I took a trip with some friends from work to the Sheyenne National Grasslands south of town. [David](https://photos.hofker.org/Travel/North-Dakota/Sheyenne-National-Grasslands/19099300_PTCWQ8#1486380880_z7jxsWG-A-LB) knew of an abandoned house in the area, so around sunset we made a short hike to it from the road. The shot below was part of a series of trial and error, where I'd hit the timer on the camera and run about 15 feet in front of the camera with my flash and point it at the side of the house. If I did it again, I'd probably put an orange gel on the flash to match the color the setting sun was giving everything else. You can find the full set [here](https://photos.hofker.org/Travel/North-Dakota/Sheyenne-National-Grasslands/).
