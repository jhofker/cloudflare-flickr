They put up art semi-recently in the new buildings at work. Some of them look pretty boring, like over-starched tie-dye t-shirts. This one is actually pretty interesting. There seems to be something printed on the individual butterflies that are made of metal, as you can see [here](https://photos.hofker.org/Other/Microsoft-Fargo-Vision/5685445_fHvQg#690502622_xCRiS).
