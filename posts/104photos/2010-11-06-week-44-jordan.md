[Previously](https://104photos.blogspot.com/2010/09/week-37-jordan_18.html), I mentioned how I would use other shots from our vacation as fallback material. Welcome to the first one of those. This shot was from the morning of our [balloon flight](https://104photos.blogspot.com/2010/09/week-37-nate.html) as they were preparing the balloons. It’s quite the process and very neat to watch. The man standing in there was actually [our pilot](https://photos.hofker.org/Travel/California/Los-Angeles/13940899_2Ake6#1024042214_DgBbH). Another balloon had a [dog helping out](https://photos.hofker.org/Travel/California/Los-Angeles/13940899_2Ake6#1024033195_JAXGx), which was cool. The dog really liked the fans.
