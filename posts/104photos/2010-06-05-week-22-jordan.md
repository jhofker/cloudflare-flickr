A day after we got back from Minneapolis, we had an unexpected trip back to Nebraska. While there, we took a trip to Omaha and I was able to take some [photos](https://photos.hofker.org/Travel/Great-Harvest-Bread/12484540_4XPLp#894795631_ZMNCj) at [Great Harvest Bread Co.](https://www.greatharvestbreadomaha.com/) (also, you should ['Like' them on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Omaha-NE/Great-Harvest-Bread-Company-Omaha-NE/188177154612) - the owners are great folks.) Tasty bread. If you haven't been there, you should go.

Oh yeah, free samples.
