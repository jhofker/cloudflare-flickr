This week, we had the pleasure of our friends Dianna and Adam stopping by with [their daughter](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jhofker/tags/emilie/) (our goddaughter) and visiting us on their way to a cabin in Minnesota. Previously, every time we've seen them, my camera has been in the car. Since I can't seem to learn a lesson from that, having them stay with us for a night meant my camera was right there and I could actually take her picture. Once she came around to us and got used to being in a different place, she was very interested in Kirby and Roxy, pointing at them and following them around. In this instance, she was following Kirby into the kitchen.
