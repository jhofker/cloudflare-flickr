Friday night was the annual Make-A-Wish gala. This year, they mixed it up a little and instead of a sit-down dinner, it was a wine tasting with food pairings. I thought it turned out well, with increased attendance this year, but I haven't heard any official numbers. In the photo below, I managed to convince our friend Dana, one of the event organizers, to "make it rain" with the tickets she had been meticulously counting while I tried to mess her up. It's likely she'll never fall for this again, but I certainly thought it was a fun photo.
