We had a nice delivery of [Great Harvest](https://www.greatharvestbreadomaha.com/) dog bones last weekend and needed to take a decent product shot of them in action. We wanted to get her holding the bone in her mouth with the words facing us, but that proved rather challenging. So, I got this instead. I rather liked how it turned out.
