This week involved absolutely no photo-taking. It did, however, include a _ton_ of video for a short skit we were making for our company holiday party. I think it turned out rather well, but we'll see how it goes over. One of the scenes involves crazy things you can do before our healthcare plan changes. So in the shot that I pulled this frame from, my friend is "drinking" "laundry detergent" and making my garage smell like detergent and Kool-aid at the same time.
