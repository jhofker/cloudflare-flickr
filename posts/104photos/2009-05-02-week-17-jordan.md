Posted this late, but I promise I had a good reason! We spent this weekend moving to our new house, where we didn’t have an internet connection (or an unsecured wireless access point around us). More on the house can be found [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jhofker/sets/72157612987309034/) if you're bored. Those photos will have to do until we're done unpacking and I take some better ones.
