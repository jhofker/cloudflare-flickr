This week was the annual company holiday parts or “Holiday Wine and Cheese”. Similar to last year when Nate and I took photos, [Ryan](https://gallery.shortyr19.com/) and I took photos throughout the event to put together a slideshow at the end. Dissimilar to last year, the slideshow wasn’t shown as the event ended early and Lightroom exports very slowly on a 2.1Ghz Pentium M.

So, here’s Santa and some elves on an escalator.
