All this week, the [Pyrotechnics Guild International](https://www.pgi.org/) has been in town. Some nights have been pretty loud with the fireworks going off until 1AM, but they're fun to watch. David and I drove out on one of the non-show nights to check out the competition fireworks. We found a nice spot on some old wire spools next to a shed and proceeded to photograph the different pieces. I thought it was pretty sweet to watch. The rest of my photos from the night are [here](https://photos.hofker.org/Events/Fargo/Pyrotechnics-Guild/).
