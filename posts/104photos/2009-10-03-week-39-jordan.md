We're not getting much of a "fall" up here in the north, and I hear the story is similar in other places. Luckily, I was able to go out on a decent day while Molly and I were in Nebraska and take a few photos. One of them actually involved leaves that had been able to change color. Pretty amazing, all things considered!
