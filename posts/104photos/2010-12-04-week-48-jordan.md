Thanksgiving was also the introduction of Kinect to the family. What that means to me, is that someone needs to take pictures for blackma fun. So, putting my flash up front under the tv and standing behind everyone while they play Dance Central seemed like the perfect idea. I didn’t think of this until three people had already played, but six turned out pretty well. Next time I’d like to do it with another (very soft) light behind the people to add a little light. Next time…
