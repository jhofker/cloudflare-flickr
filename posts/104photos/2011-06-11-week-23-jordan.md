Who has four thumbs and are totally getting married this weekend? These two.  
Right, so, my "baby" brother is getting married. I took [a few](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jhofker/sets/72157626858679959) photos during the rehearsal and the day of the wedding, so you can safely expect these to be used when I didn't take anything for the week.

Also enjoy a bonus picture of Jameson from the night before. I can't remember who I forced to hold the flash/umbrella/stand above him, but thanks to that person!
