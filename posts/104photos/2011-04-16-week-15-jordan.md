Nate and I attended The Flash Bus in Minneapolis this weekend. While I didn't take nearly as many pictures as I thought I would, I definitely learned a lot. Both [Joe](https://www.joemcnally.com/blog/) and [David](https://www.strobist.com) are incredibly knowledgable guys and I'm really glad I was able to see them.
