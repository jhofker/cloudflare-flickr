What have I been doing? Well, I haven’t been doing a good job of taking photos this last week. I did a very short portrait session with someone at worked (their college needed a photo for a promotional thing), but for some reason, he didn’t want his photo posted everywhere. Short of that, I’ve been watering our (new!) lawn. I have a pair of shoes dedicated to this task because it gets a little wet.
