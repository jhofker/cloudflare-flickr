This weekend, we worked a bit on [painting our office](https://photos.hofker.org/Other/Our-House/10044901_9Fuff#812922070_L34Ax) and putting together our new desks from our trip to Ikea when we were in Minneapolis. Having the new desks together means I have a little extra space. Extra space means I brought out the LEGO blocks. I messed around a little with them. The story below has a moral - something about robots.
