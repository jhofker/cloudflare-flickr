Spring has finally come to Fargo, so we're catching up to everyone else on things turning green, budding, and blooming. I'm very happy to see that all of our plants survived their first winter in our yard and survived the annoying and damaging voles that lived under the snow all winter. It's great to see those little leaves growing out to soak up the sun.
