Tuesday morning, we were woken up by a pretty strong storm going and the local tornado sirens going off. That's sure what I want to have to think about at 4:30AM, but whatever, Mother Nature! Once the storm passed and I determined I would feel worse if I tried to sleep for an extra hour, I went outside to catch some of the super-crazy lightning on the back of the storm. There was simply a ton, which made getting this shot pretty easy.
