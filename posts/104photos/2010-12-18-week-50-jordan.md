Last night was the [Fargo Force](https://fargoforce.com/) Make-A-Wish night where a group of families and volunteers attend, and the kids go out on the ice during the first two periods. Fans are encouraged to donate to the foundation and it’s all-around a pretty cool event that I think the kids enjoy.

I’m along to [take a few pictures](https://photos.hofker.org/Events/Make-a-Wish/fargo-force-2010) during the game and during their time on the ice, although I’m pretty sure I look weird walking around while they’re all standing still. Oh well. We had our friends come along and their son, Noah, attended his first hockey game.
