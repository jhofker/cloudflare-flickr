My photo this week is a sun rise with a twist. I'd been waiting most of the winter for [sun dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dog) and had to chase them down when I saw them. Ended up going into the parking lot of Horizon, climbing into the snow, and taking a few photos. Once back in my car, I started putting my camera away, but wanted to check the shots first. When I tried to look, I realized I didnâ€™t have a card in my camera, so I had to do it all over again.

Cold feet, but cool sun. It was like this for the rest of the day.
