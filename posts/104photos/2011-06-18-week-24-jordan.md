While in Lincoln for my [brother's wedding](https://www.104photos.com/2011/06/week-23-jordan.html), we had a chance to visit our good friends and our Goddaughter Emily (you may remember her from [last year](https://www.104photos.com/2010/07/week-30-jordan.html)) who has grown up quite a bit since we last saw her!
