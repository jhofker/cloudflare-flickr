Two weeks ago, we moved into a new building at work. The full set of photos of it are still coming, as I currently lack several things necessary to appropriately photograph the buildings (among them: health, battery charger, and time). It will happen, however, but for now, I’ll leave you with a photo of the outside of the two new buildings. Yes, they aren’t landscaped yet. If it’s neat when it’d done, expect photos of that, too.
