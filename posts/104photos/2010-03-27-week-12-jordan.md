We've been taking Roxy on daily walks to help burn off some of her extra energy. It's been pleasantly nice out, but there isn't a large number of interesting things along our walking path. Also, it'd be kind of creepy to take pictures of the other people we see!

I know you're thinking, "Aww what? Clouds?" Yeah, clouds. And they're neat.
