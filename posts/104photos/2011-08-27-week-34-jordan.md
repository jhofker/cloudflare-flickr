Last weekend we attended Andrea's first birthday party. She was very quiet and mellow the whole time. She didn't really attack her cake, either. She just sat there and peacefully picked off the small decorative frosting pieces and ate them, one-by-one, while everyone watched. I'm fairly certain she thought we were all quite weird. The rest of the set is [here](https://photos.hofker.org/Events/Birthdays/Andreas-First-Birthday/18643751_JRcmXg#1441006837_fn9VZmt).
