My photo this week is a result of last night’s festivities with bacon.

I like the lighting coming from behind the bowl of pork and I’m pleased with the sharpness in the middle.

If I was able to do it again, I’d increase the depth of field so all of it was sharp and I’d move the placemat out of the top right corner. I might even polish up the bowl a bit more and remove the stray sauce on the left.
