Happy Halloween! We decided to celebrate a little early, since Halloween itself falls on Monday. We got together as a group at our friends' house and had a good time chatting, eating, and playing games. I set up a very impromptu area to takes pictures of everyone in their costumes and then forced everyone to show up for a group photo. If you guys ever read these, thanks for putting up with it! The rest of the Halloween photos are [here](https://photos.hofker.org/Holidays/Halloween-2011).
