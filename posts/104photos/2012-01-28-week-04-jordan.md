One of my favorite things we saw in Seattle was the [EMP Museum](https://www.empmuseum.org/index.asp) and _especially_ the Battlestar Galactica exhibit inside. It was just really fun seeing props and set pieces from a show I watched growing up (thanks, Dad!) and the newer series more recently. I'm sad that the exhibit is ending, but the [one that will be replacing it](https://www.empmuseum.org/exhibitions/index.asp?categoryID=177&ccID=337) sounds pretty neat, too.
