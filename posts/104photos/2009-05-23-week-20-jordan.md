This week we had our annual all-campus All-Hands meeting where we talked about stuff that I won’t bore you with here. After that, we had a “wine & cheese” celebration back at work where there was food, drinks, and yard games. Despite the name (and anyone familiar with these events already knows this), there’s an absence of wine and only a little cheese at these events. I had fun anyway, as it was a nice day out and I got to take a [few pictures](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jhofker/sets/72157618470834137/). My favorite is below, which I think is best [viewed large on black](https://www.bighugelabs.com/flickr/onblack.php?id=3550787536&size=large).
