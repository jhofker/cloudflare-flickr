Spent the weekend in Bismarck for the Make-A-Wish “World of Wishes” gala. I thought I’d get out and see the city a little bit, but it’s kind of hard to shoot with a puppy attached to your arm, so that went out the window.

During the event, they had a neat group called “The Strolling Strings of Bismarck” play. Much like it sounds, they walk around and play. The age range seems to be middle school to high school aged kids. It was definitely something unique which made the event enjoyable.
