My photo this week is of someone who seems to be a regular visitor to our apartment complex: firefighters. Twice yesterday, these guys and [their engine](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jhofker/3353963742/) came out to our complex to deal with an errant smoke detector. The goal of this shot was to drag the shutter and make it appear that they were hustling and bustling around because of it - a lie! How well do you think it worked?
