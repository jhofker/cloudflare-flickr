I recently joined the [Civil Air Patrol](https://www.gocivilairpatrol.com/) here in Fargo. It's been an interesting experience. This time of year, our primary mission is taking photographs of the rivers and roads as they flood. This helps local decision-makers actually make their decisions about putting up dikes, sandbags, etc. Pretty neat. Flying in a small plane like the one below and taking pictures out of the window is certainly a new challenge.
