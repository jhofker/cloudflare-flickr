Earlier this week was the annual [United Way Day of Caring](https://www.uwcc.net/services-dev-day.php) in Fargo. My team from work grouped together to go help a few local senior citizens with fall yard work and house cleaning. Definitely a worthwhile event. I didn’t have a chance to take too many photos as I was actually doing stuff, but you can see all twelve photos [here](https://photos.hofker.org/Events/Microsoft/day-of-caring-2010/14196518_6tqzQ#1048343851_wfFmm).
