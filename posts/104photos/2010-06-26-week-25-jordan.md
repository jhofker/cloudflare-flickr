It's been pretty nice out. The clouds actually looked pretty fantastic, so I was looking for a good setting to take this. However, I was afraid the clouds or the sun would run away from me before I was able to, so I stuck with the backyard.  
  
I really need to improve my HDR technique to include closing down the aperture more and, I don't know, actually using my tripod. In the small version, you can't really see it, but there's some pretty bad fringing around the houses. Let's have that be our little secret, alright?
