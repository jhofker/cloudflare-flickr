I was very excited that we had our first "real" thunderstorm of the year. So excited that I tried to go to the park just south of us to take pictures because I knew it's dark there. That didn't work out when it started raining, so I retreated back to the house. Couldn't shoot through a window because it was getting hit by rain, so I opened the garage door and setup the tripod. I took 5 or so 30 second shots like this one before I got it right and then just crossed my fingers that lightning would happen where I was aimed during those 30 seconds.
