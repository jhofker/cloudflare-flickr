A few weeks ago, we took a trip to Minneapolis to watch the Huskers play the Gophers. It was nice to see a solid win _and_ a ~50% red audience. We had a nice time driving around the city. We made a stop in the Microsoft store in the Mall of America and visited the Kinect "booth" they have setup near the amusement park. Pretty nice, I think, demoing yet-to-be-released games and all. Anyway, here's a photo of the stadium from our seats.
