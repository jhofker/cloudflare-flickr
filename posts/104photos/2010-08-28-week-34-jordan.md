You may remember that [previously](https://104photos.blogspot.com/2009/07/week-27-jordan.html) we discussed my ability (or lack thereof) to grow grass in our backyard. Well, as you can see below, the backyard has filled in quite a bit. Thanks to a generous donation of time and effort from my father-in-law, we managed to landscape a small portion of it as well. Various birds (not pictured because I'm super-scary) seem to enjoy this little area and eat most all of the seed I put out for them within a day or so.
