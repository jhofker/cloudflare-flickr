My friend David and I will be putting on an informal "Flash 101" workshop in a few weeks, so we got together to practice a few things. David gave me permission to use a photo of him where, as he said, he didn't look like a "goober". So, here's this. We were trying things out in my living room, which, after moving all the furniture, did not leave us with a ton of working space. David had to sit pretty close to the backdrop, which is why there's a shadow on it behind him. I shot this with two softboxes stacked on each other, with my lens in between them. It's an interesting effect (to me) because of how it fills otherwise shadowy areas.
