While [Nate was enjoying himself](https://104photos.blogspot.com/2010/08/week-32-nate.html) in the comforts of an air-conditioned home, I was outside sweating in the same city. When we made it to Kauffman Stadium for the Yankees at Royals games, the temperature outside was a brisk 108. Yeah, that felt pretty warm coming from the 70-80 degrees that Fargo was having at the time. For those keeping track, we drove to Nebraska last weekend and Kansas City this weekend. It was also my birthday (and my brother's, and my dad's) so there's that.  
  
[Kansas City was nice](https://photos.hofker.org/Travel/Kansas-City/13372522_kbnha#972484025_pWJyr) to visit and it was doubly nice that my great aunt and uncle let us stay with them. I wish we had had a chance to stop by and see Nate and Nila, but the schedule just didn't quite work out. Good thing we get to see them in a few weeks!
