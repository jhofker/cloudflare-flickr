Yeah, two pet posts in a row. Sorry.

Roxy and Kirby seem to be getting along better these days. They were just laying like this on the couch, so of course a [bunch](https://photos.hofker.org/Animals/Mixed-Pets/10629595_VcNNV#739290822_hGpb4) of pictures had to be taken. This is probably my favorite of the bunch, but your opinion may differ. I just like her expression.
