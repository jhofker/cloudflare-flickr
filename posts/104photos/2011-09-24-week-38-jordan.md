Came back to Nebraska for the annual Raikes alumni event. It was a great time getting to see everyone again. Of course, I didn't take my camera with me to that. I did, however, decide it would be a great time to try out some astrophotography while staying at my parents' house. So, here's my first try at it. In the pitch black, I set up my camera on the tripod and moved my flash around to various locations around the house to light it. Combined those afterwards. The house is slightly blurry because, as I was stumbling around in the dark, I kind of tripped over the tripod.
