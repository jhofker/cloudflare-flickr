I traveled to Seattle this week for work and for an extra day to see the sights. Unfortunately for my work plans, it snowed pretty good that entire week, essentially shutting down the city. I poked plenty of fun at my team members out there, but safe is certainly better than sorry. So, here's Microsoft's buildings 40 and 41, where I was working. You can view the full set of photos from the trip [here](https://photos.hofker.org/Travel/Washington/Seattle/21090903_k5FCHs#!i=1677416071&k=nqN9GjR).
