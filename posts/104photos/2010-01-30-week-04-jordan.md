[Make-A-Wish](https://www.northdakota.wish.org/)'s annual [Walk for Wishes](https://northdakota.wish.org/2010/01/04/statewide-walk-for-wishes/) event is next weekend at the [UP Center](https://www.upcenterfargo.com/), where I'll be the creepy guy taking pictures of everyone. It should be a good time. Most people, for some reason, assume that the walk takes place on the actual ice rink (pictured below), but it's actually through the concourse above. Lighting isn't great up there, so I usually camp out near a window to get decent shots.

Below is an HDR of the ice rink. Being handheld and all, I think it turned out pretty well.
