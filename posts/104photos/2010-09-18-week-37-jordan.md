Like Nate said, [Vacation](https://104photos.blogspot.com/2010/09/week-36-nate.html)! We’ve been traveling this last week and it’s probably safe to expect vacation photos used as fallback material if I don’t happen to shoot during a week. This makes all of you incredibly excited, I know.

The photo below is from our layover in Salt Lake City. We managed to get to our terminal right as sunset was hitting above the plane we’d be boarding. Since I had been wanting to see if anyone would harass a guy taking pictures of planes, it seemed like the perfect time to do it.

The rest of my photos from the trip can be found [right here](https://photos.hofker.org/Travel/California/Los-Angeles/13940899_2Ake6#1023805365_qifoq).

No one bugged me.
