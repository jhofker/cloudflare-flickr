It’s been a…crazy week or so up here in Fargo. Flooding, snow storms and freezing, flooding, and more flooding. Not to mention sandbags, dikes, and levees. My photo this week is of all that stands in the way of flood waters and my area of town. They’ve been building it like crazy over the last week, so we’re very thankful that it was finished in time.
