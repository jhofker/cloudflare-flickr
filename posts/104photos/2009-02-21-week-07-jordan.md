Saw an awesomely bright sundog the other morning, so I grabbed a few pictures to make an HDR out of it.

Canon XSi with 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 IS @ 18mm 1/1600s f/5.6 ISO 100. 3 bracketed shots, combined in Photomatix.

I only wish my UV filter hadnâ€™t flared up during this. I really should just remove it.
