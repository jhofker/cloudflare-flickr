Easter weekend we made a quick trip back to town to see the families. It was also Molly's grandma's 80th birthday, so that was pretty cool, too! The cake below was a gift from and made by Kristin from [thé Cup](https://thecuplincoln.com/) in Lincoln. The cake itself was very tasty. I didn't have a chance to sit and have a cup of coffee when we picked it up, but thé Cup seems like a nice little place.
