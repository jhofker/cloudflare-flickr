On Wednesday we had a going-away dinner for some friends that are moving to Seattle. The way seating worked out, I didn’t really sit near enough to them to get many photos (one group photo has most of them in it). Instead, Joel, Meghan, and Noah were close enough for me to pester for the night. Noah is growing very quickly and looked pretty darn cute in his sweater vest.
