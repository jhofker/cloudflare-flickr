Like I said last week, I recently started volunteering at the Humane Society. What you can expect from that is a lot of my weekly photos will be related to it. :-) In this instance, I decided I needed some practice with my technique. Kirby (my cat) was nice enough to hop in front of my camera and sit there while I tried some things out.
