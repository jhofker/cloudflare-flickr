This week was the annual [DigiGirlz technology camp](https://www.microsoft.com/about/diversity/programs/digigirlz/default.aspx) on our campus. It's a three day camp where the (135) attendees learn about programming, tech careers, and various technologies. It looks like a great camp to me and the girls seemed like they had a lot of fun.  
  
When we got back from our trip to Nebraska (that I mentioned [last week](https://104photos.blogspot.com/2010/06/week-22-jordan.html)), I had two calendar invites in my inbox asking me to take a whole group picture and individual team shots. It sounded interesting to me, so I went and gave it a [shot or 33](https://photos.hofker.org/Events/Microsoft/DigiGirlz-2010/).
