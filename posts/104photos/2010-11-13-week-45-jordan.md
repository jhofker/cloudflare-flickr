We had a rather long walk from our parking spot to the Santa Monica Pier when we decided it would be a nice place to visit. Our [view was pretty nice](https://photos.hofker.org/Travel/California/Los-Angeles/13940899_2Ake6#1024058827_dJZq9-A-LB) from there, too.

This guy was taking a nap from his hard day of work playing the guitar at the top of the cliff.
