This week was the annual Make-A-Wish of North Dakota’s One Enchanted Evening Gala. It’s a pretty big fundraiser for them and has been a good time both times I’ve been there. Molly is pretty responsible for planning the event, so props to her for putting together a great evening. You can find all of the photos from the event [here.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jhofker/sets/72157622283304121/)
