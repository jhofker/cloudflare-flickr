Like I mentioned last week, it was my birthday. My wonderful wife surprised me with a new fancy thing to attach to the camera - namely Sigma's 30mm lens. It's pretty neat. Naturally, I had to test it out. I used it a little last weekend at the baseball game, but this week I actually got Roxy to sit still for me.  
  
This also made me finally make the effort to rework my [photo site](https://photos.hofker.org/) (hosted by the awesome folks at [SmugMug](https://www.smugmug.com)) so that when I hand people neat [Moo](https://www.moo.com) cards, they don't think it was a trick. There's a few things I need to fix, but I mostly like how it turned out.
