I hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving. We had a good time - traveled to Nebraska and saw family. I was lucky enough to go to the Husker game with my dad while I was in town, which was fun (and we won). The photo below is Molly's uncle, Jimmy, being Spiderman. He owns a gym in Lincoln and is fairly practiced at jumping up to the wall and staying there for a bit.
