What a year it was! We bought a [house](https://photos.hofker.org/Other/Our-House/10044901_9Fuff#688026533_iPFJx), added [Roxy](https://photos.hofker.org/Animals/Roxy/10041621_LJPAb#688027067_c7hRa) to the family, Nate got [married](https://photos.hofker.org/Weddings/Henderson-Wedding/10048202_hPv3U#690522935_vfq72), I moved to a new building at [work](https://photos.hofker.org/Other/Microsoft-Fargo-Vision/5685445_fHvQg#739287716_JJh2D), and we celebrated a [few](https://photos.hofker.org/Holidays/Halloween-2009/10165238_Kqd9Z "Halloween 2009") [different](https://photos.hofker.org/Holidays/Thanksgiving-2009/10519019_sDgRN "Thanksgiving 2009") [holidays](https://photos.hofker.org/Holidays/Christmas-2009/10691287_aaM9e "Christmas 2009").

The pictures below are all the ones I’ve posted here this year. Why does it look like I’m missing one? Beats me. If you know what picture I’m missing from this, let me know! I’d pick a favorite out of them, but I can’t really do that. I can, however, let _you_.

So, which was **your** favorite from the year?
