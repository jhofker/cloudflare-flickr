Last Sunday was my birthday, so I suckered Molly into letting me go to the "Fargo AirSho". I spent a few hours there getting sunburned and taking some photos. Even got an additional shot of the [Civil Air Patrol plane](https://photos.hofker.org/Events/Fargo/Fargo-AirSho-2011/18575835_jZhqg5#1443505647_vV9zDD5-A-LB) I've [written about previously](https://www.104photos.com/2011/04/week-14-jordan.html).  
  
In the photo below, there was an F-16 demonstration (by the Viper team, I think). I didn't know clouds did that when the sun comes through them, but I suppose it makes sense.
