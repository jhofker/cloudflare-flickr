As it turns out, [last week’s experiment](https://104photos.blogspot.com/2010/10/week-42-jordan.html) with getting off-camera lighting going with my camera was time well spent. Today (well, tonight) we hosted a Halloween party and most everyone even dressed up! We had a [jailbird](https://photos.hofker.org/Holidays/Halloween-2010/14457587_SGzjg#1072852613_Nrv6X), an [animal family](https://photos.hofker.org/Holidays/Halloween-2010/14457587_SGzjg#1072851377_Ux62H), a [Minecraft creeper](https://photos.hofker.org/Holidays/Halloween-2010/14457587_SGzjg#1072853369_S7Cjs) ([huh?](https://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Creeper)), a [snow ninja](https://photos.hofker.org/Holidays/Halloween-2010/14457587_SGzjg#1072854028_LMMq7), a [doctor](https://photos.hofker.org/Holidays/Halloween-2010/14457587_SGzjg#1072854652_aFT79), a [door-to-door witness](https://photos.hofker.org/Holidays/Halloween-2010/14457587_SGzjg#1072855157_x2P3H), [Snooki and the Situation](https://photos.hofker.org/Holidays/Halloween-2010/14457587_SGzjg#1072855742_UffQX), [vampires with their cute pet ladybug](https://photos.hofker.org/Holidays/Halloween-2010/14457587_SGzjg#1072856939_PktV6), and [Amelia Earhart with her doctor husband](https://photos.hofker.org/Holidays/Halloween-2010/14457587_SGzjg#1072856391_ZZWSb) and their [not-allowed-on-Apple-products baby](https://photos.hofker.org/Holidays/Halloween-2010/14457587_SGzjg#1072860160_3nHVJ) ([huh?](https://www.foxtrot.com/2010/03/03212010/)).

For the costume photos, I had my external flash sitting on the countertop being triggered by my camera. My goal, in the limited space I had (our kitchen), was to hit everyone from the side and get their shadow up on the wall for a more “Halloween-y” look. Next year? More lights, I hope!
