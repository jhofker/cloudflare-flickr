Today, a few of us made the drive to Shakopee, MN for the 2010 Renaissance Festival (Something I totally bet [Nate will do](https://104photos.blogspot.com/2010/10/week-42-nate.html) in a few weeks). It was actually my first time at a faire, but it was definitely a good time. I mean, [Kurt bought some sweet new boots](https://photos.hofker.org/Events/Minnesota-Rennaissance/14131508_E6FKE#1041988339_aiaL2), there was a [cool juggling dude](https://photos.hofker.org/Events/Minnesota-Rennaissance/14131508_E6FKE#1041984657_P5s2o), a [lady with a giant snake](https://photos.hofker.org/Events/Minnesota-Rennaissance/14131508_E6FKE#1041996362_gzs3q), a [very dirty girl](https://photos.hofker.org/Events/Minnesota-Rennaissance/14131508_E6FKE#1042004404_T5q42), a [Grand Marshal with an awesome ‘stache](https://photos.hofker.org/Events/Minnesota-Rennaissance/14131508_E6FKE#1042007882_rkZSM), [hard-hitting live jousting](https://photos.hofker.org/Events/Minnesota-Rennaissance/14131508_E6FKE#1042026655_fvC8D) (and [a horse](https://photos.hofker.org/Events/Minnesota-Rennaissance/14131508_E6FKE#1042068876_tsvDE), for Nila), and my personal favorite, [Kurt being a dragon for a musical group](https://photos.hofker.org/Events/Minnesota-Rennaissance/14131508_E6FKE#1042050486_dGmPU).
