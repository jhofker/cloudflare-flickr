This week was the annual [Microsoft Night at the Zoo](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jhofker/sets/72157618165034872/), where, strangely enough, we go to [the zoo](https://www.redriverzoo.org/). It was a pretty good time; a little cold and breezy, but the [kids there](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jhofker/3532065359/in/set-72157618165034872/) seemed to be having fun. My boss told me that these red pandas never did anything except sleep, but they were awake andâ€¦eating lots of grass. [Jeremy](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jhofker/3532032193/in/set-72157618165034872/) shook his keys to get this one to look up.
