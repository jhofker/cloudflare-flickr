Mom will probably kill me, but that's too bad! Also, it'll be awhile before I go back to Nebraska, so maybe she'll forget by then.

She wanted a new picture for her profile picture on Twitter and various other things, so I took a few while we were [snowed in](https://photos.hofker.org/Holidays/Christmas-2009/10691287_aaM9e#752069510_Nnz3g-A-LB) on Christmas. This was my favorite of the bunch. Unfortunately, I realized later that the different light temperatures were, well, _different_, so I couldn't completely correct for it.

Other pictures from Christmas are [here](https://photos.hofker.org/Holidays/Christmas-2009/).
