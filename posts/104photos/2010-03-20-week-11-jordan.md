Have I mentioned that it floods yearly up here in Fargo? Well, it does. I made a [Photosynth](https://bit.ly/cUv159) (the panoramic version) of the area pictured below. This playhouse is just to the right of the Photosynth. The [same area on Bing maps](https://bit.ly/appGQW) shows that, normally, the water is back behind the trees, and not in these folks' backyards.
