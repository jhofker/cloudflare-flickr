I hope you all had a wonderful Thanksgiving. We drove down to Nebraska for a few days and in typical day-after-Thanksgiving fashion (well, every other year), I was able to go to the Husker game. This was the first time I took my camera in with me, which was interesting. They didn’t give me any trouble, but it isn’t the easiest thing to use when you in a packed stadium. I managed to make a [shaky video](https://photos.hofker.org/Travel/Nebraska/Lincoln-NE/10048259_6aH5E#1109428445_GVnD6-A-LB) and took a [few other pictures](https://photos.hofker.org/Holidays/thanksgiving-2010/14869033_RodyC#1128044055_u6GEB), though.
