This weekend we went to the [FM Derby Girls](https://www.fmderbygirls.com/) roller derby bout against Duluth. I thought it was pretty fun to go see, although the Civic Center is a little older and the seats are kind of cramped. If you haven't seen [roller derby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_derby) before, you should give it a shot - it's definitely interesting.  
  
This is the first time I've tried faking the "tilt-shift" effect, but I rather like how it turned out. There's certainly a bit of thinking necessary to get it right, and I'm not even sure I did.
