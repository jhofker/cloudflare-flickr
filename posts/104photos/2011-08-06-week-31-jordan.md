This weekend, we tried to go [disc golfing](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jhofker/6047734535/), but we got rained on instead. We ended up back at Kurt's house, where I proceeded to annoy his cats by trying to take their picture. The one below is Buddy, who, prior to this photo, had been sucking on that purple mouse (which is full of catnip). He was feeling pretty good.  
  
After that, I had to depart to go do home things like fix a toilet and install a ceiling fan. The rest of the guys went downtown and ended up on a [scavenger hunt of sorts](https://www.transtemporaldetectiveagency.com/). I think those of us that missed out on it will be going next weekend.
