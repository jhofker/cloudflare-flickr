Happy 4th of July! Molly's parents came up to join us and I didn't end up taking too many pictures. However, the night of the 4th I went and walked around for a bit, hoping to catch someone's late-night fireworks show. Unfortunately, I didn't get any single person's show, but I did get a bunch of random ones while standing on a mosquito-covered bridge a block south of our house.
