Earlier today I was playing with the 7D’s ability to remotely command off-camera flashes. Up until now, I haven’t been able to, well, make it work, but I finally got it tonight.

The downside to the Canon system is that the on-camera flash is required to trigger any other flashes. Normally, this isn’t _too big_ of an issue, but in my case, I’m right in Roxy’s face (as she would certainly tell you) and the on-camera flash was affecting the picture. So, this was taking with one hand being used to block the on-camera flash from hitting her, but far enough away that my external flash sitting on a foot stool to my left would see and trigger off of it. Got that?

Those of you more familiar with what I’m talking about might be wondering why I don’t get some other type of wireless trigger. Fact is, I have a Cactus V2s set that works most of the time, but takes CR2 batteries which I don’t really have on-hand. I would love a set of the much-more-reliable [V4 triggers](https://www.mpex.com/browse.cfm/4,12662.html), or heck, [Pocket Wizards](https://www.amazon.com/PocketWizard-PWP-TR-801-125-Transceiver-Black/dp/B000GHXMO8/ref=wl_it_dp_o?ie=UTF8&coliid=I1WZG940QAMTKS&colid=3EEB974B697W5), but I’m not really good enough at it to need those.

If you’re curious to learn more about what-the-heck I just said, I’d suggest starting here with [David Hobby’s excellent series of articles](https://strobist.blogspot.com/2006/03/lighting-101.html) about off-camera lighting.
