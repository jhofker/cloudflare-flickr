The end of the year is coming up pretty quick on us and it's about this time that I start wondering if I'm using the right number on each post.

Oh well.

Yesterday was our annual company holiday party. This year it was held at a new venue, named The Venue (creative, eh?), which was (in my mind) a lot better than previous years. There was a full stage, so I was able to walk up/around/in front of the band while they were playing and take pictures and things were just pretty neat. My friend in the photo below (you may remember him from the [last time](https://www.104photos.com/2011/11/week-46-jordan.html) I mentioned the company party) recently joined the band and was belting out one of his songs. You can see the rest of the party photos [here](https://photos.hofker.org/Events/Microsoft/HWC-2011/20525757_bcD4g6#1625689976_T8VbJsb).
