Finally took a few pictures of the outside of the house after we’ve done landscaping and planted trees. How’s the backyard? Not ready for pictures. Hopefully it will start sprouting grass soon, though. If you want, you can compare the photo below to the original look of the front of the house that I’ve posted before!
