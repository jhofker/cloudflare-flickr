Holy cow, only two more weeks! (Well, more like 1.5)

I finally got around to taking a picture of our Christmas tree (as inspired by [Stolee](https://www.stoleetech.com/)) and posting it online. Gifts under the tree were expertly wrapped by Molly, in case you were wondering. I’m pretty sure none of them are for either of us, but the tree makes a decent storage spot until we drive to Nebraska for Christmas.
