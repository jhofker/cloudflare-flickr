Travelled to Minneapolis this weekend for a quick trip. Molly had never been there, let alone to the Mall of America, so it'd seemed as good of a time as any to go. I didn't take as many pictures as I thought I would, mainly because I didn't carry the camera everywhere with me - I know, shame on me. I took a few out the window of our hotel room and one of them is below.
