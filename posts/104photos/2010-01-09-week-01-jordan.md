Alright, starting again! I've published fewer pictures recently because I've been trying to use the camera below. I haven't yet gone through a roll of film on it, but I'm getting close. It's currently loaded up with Ilford Delta Pro 400 B&W, so I'm looking forward to seeing how the photos come out.

  

Below is an [Olympus OM-10](https://www.thecamerasite.net/01_SLR_Cameras/Pages/olympus10.htm) SLR camera. It belonged to my parents and now I've, uh, borrowed it.
