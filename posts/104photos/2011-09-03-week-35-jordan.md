Molly, her parents, and I took a trip to Colorado last weekend. I'm sure I'll use more of these when I fail to take a photo for the week, but this is a good place to start. This is the main office / owner's house of the cabins we stayed at. The owners are originally from Nebraska, so it was comforting to see a nice "HUSKERS" doorstop when we arrived. The cabins are right along a small stream, which provided the right amount of white noise and scenery to enjoy our time.
