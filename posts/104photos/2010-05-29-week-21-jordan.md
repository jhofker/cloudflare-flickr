[![](https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4052/4658224323_d2b6815bf1_m.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jhofker/4658224323/)This weekend (the 31st, actually) is our two-year anniversary. We took a trip to Minneapolis to celebrate and just to have a short vacation. We fit in quite a few activities during the trip, like checking out the outlet mall outside of Minneapolis, eating at [The Nook](https://www.crnook.com/), meeting some friends for dinner at [Psycho Suzi's Motor Lounge](https://psychosuzis.com/) where I injured our waitress, and visiting [Como Park Zoo and Conservatory](https://www.comozooconservatory.org/) in St. Paul. It was definitely a fun trip that we'll have to do again sometime. The rest of the photos I posted from our trip are [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jhofker/sets/72157624054377009/).
