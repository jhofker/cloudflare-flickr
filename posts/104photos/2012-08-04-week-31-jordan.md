My brother, sister-in-law, sister, and niece came up to visit us this weekend and we tried to do a 8/9-month photo shoot with my niece. As I'm sure Nate knows, when dealing with a little one that young, things don't always go as planned. Four or five shots and then things break down for a bit. At least it was a really nice day. :-)
