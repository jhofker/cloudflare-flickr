One day during our trip, while everyone else went to do the smart thing and nap for a bit, I sto…borrowed…Nate’s wide angle lens to get some photos of the house we were renting. I didn’t take many indoors due to not wanting to wake the slumbering folks with the (very) creaky floorboards.

I did, however, walk around outside a bit. It was a [nice little place](https://froghollowhouse.com/) to stay – definitely in the perfect location. Once again, the trip photos can be found [here](https://photos.hofker.org/Travel/California/Los-Angeles/13940899_2Ake6#1023958609_Gsx8x).
