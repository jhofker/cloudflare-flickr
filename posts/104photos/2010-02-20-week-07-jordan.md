This weekend we had the wonderful opportunity to lose our power for a few hours one night. We're rather fond of electricity, so being without was a little annoying. I grabbed a couple outdoor solar lights that had charged up over the day and placed them in the house for some light.  
  
And then I went outside to see what the neighborhood was like in the dark. Fortunately (or not), the neighborhood right next to us hadn't lost power, so it kept us pretty well lit up.
