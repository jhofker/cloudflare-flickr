This is Rosebud. She was tired from walking around a hot parking lot and decided to take a nap. For more information about Rosebud and her owner Ellen, go [here](https://www.agweek.com/articles/?id=3434&article_id=115127&property_id=40). I promise, itâ€™s a good story. You can view more pictures of Rosebud, Ellen, and the Walk For Wishes in Grand Forks [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jhofker/sets/72157620501000377/).
