Roxy and I spent some time in the backyard the other night trying to burn off some of her energy. I left her leash and chain hooked to her, but not attached to anything else. That way, if she decided to make a break for it, I could easily catch her. Eventually, I'm sure (ha!) I'll be able to trust her enough not to just barrel away through weeds and mud, but not yet. So we play fetch with the lease attached. She didn't seem to mind.
