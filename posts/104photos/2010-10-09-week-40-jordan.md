It seems like it’s unseasonably warm up here, so as not to look a gift horse in the mouth, we thought we’d take Roxy out for a walk and to play a little fetch. This being something we haven’t done recently, she completely wore herself out.

Which is just fine by us. She definitely deserved her rest after all that running.
