Like I said, lots of niece photos! New Year's Eve, we did a very impromptu shoot at a friend's house. Did a few quick "one-month" shots of my niece and brother/sis-in-law and then a couple friends were there [with their son](https://photos.hofker.org/Holidays/New-Years-Eve-2011/20863136_Jh4t2B#!i=1656860439&k=8wtZSwc), so I did a few of them, too.
