Technically two separate images, but putting them together with a border makes a diptych which is one image, right? Anyway, the left side gives you context, the right side gives you the details. This is some flooding next to the interstate about 15 or 20 miles south of Fargo. Yes, that’s water, and yes, that should be an interstate exit. It’s pretty crazy.
