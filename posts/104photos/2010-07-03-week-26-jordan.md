Last Sunday, we had a visitor for a couple hours. Due to weird pick-up times at the local dog 'hotel', we housed Cliff and Jess's puppy, Bella, for a bit. Roxy and Bella got along rather well, [chasing each other around the living room](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jhofker/4748157444) for a good while.
