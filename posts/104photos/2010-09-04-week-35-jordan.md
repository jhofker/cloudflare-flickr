As always seems to happen when you have [something going on outdoors](https://photos.hofker.org/Travel/North-Dakota/Our-House/10044901_9Fuff#994587740_utrQ9), it's been raining a fair bit here recently. This wall of rain was just south of us. Even though it missed us, the rest didn't. There's enough standing water out there now to allow some nice little mosquitoes to breed, which should be great, too!
